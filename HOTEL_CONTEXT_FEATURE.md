## üìä Example Output

```json
{
  "hotel_context": {
    "status": "success",
    "destination": "Tokyo",
    "duration_days": 5,
    "where_to_stay": {
      "top_areas": [
        {
          "name": "Asakusa",
          "description": "Street food & ancient Sens≈ç-ji temple",
          "score": 4.5,
          "known_for": ["Sens≈ç-ji", "Shopping", "Green spaces"]
        }
      ],
      "source": "web_search_ai"
    },
    "when_to_visit": {
      "current_month": {
        "month": "October",
        "temp_range": "17¬∞C - 21¬∞C",
        "weather": "Mostly sunny",
        "crowd_level": "Busy",
        "price_level": "$$$"
      },
      "best_value_months": [...],
      "peak_season_months": [...]
    },
    "what_youll_pay": {
      "by_star_rating": [
        {
          "stars": 3,
          "avg_price": 29000,
          "range": "LKR24K-LKR43K",
          "count": "114+ hotels",
          "label": "Typical"
        }
      ]
    },
    "tips": [
      "üèôÔ∏è Asakusa is a top choice for visitors (Score: 4.5/5)",
      "üí∞ Best value: January typically has lower hotel prices"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User submits travel request** with `include_hotel_context: true` (default)
2. **Hotel Search Agent** searches for hotels
3. **Hotel Context Service** runs 3 concurrent tasks:
   - Web search for best neighborhoods
   - Web search for seasonal information
   - Analysis of real hotel price data
4. **AI (Grok) analyzes** and structures the web search results
5. **Data is returned** to the orchestrator
6. **Frontend displays** the context in beautiful cards

## üîë Key Differences from Hardcoded Data

### Before (Hardcoded):
- ‚ùå Limited to predefined cities (Tokyo, Paris, London)
- ‚ùå Static data that never updates
- ‚ùå No real-time information

### After (Dynamic API):
- ‚úÖ Works for ANY city worldwide
- ‚úÖ Real-time data from web searches
- ‚úÖ AI-generated recommendations based on current information
- ‚úÖ Actual hotel pricing from search results

## üí° Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Works for any destination, not just hardcoded ones
2. **Freshness**: Always up-to-date information
3. **Accuracy**: Based on real web data and actual hotel prices
4. **User Experience**: Google Hotels-level insights
5. **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered tips and suggestions

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- Cache frequently searched destinations
- Add user reviews and ratings integration
- Include nearby attractions for each neighborhood
- Price prediction for future dates
- Historical pricing trends
