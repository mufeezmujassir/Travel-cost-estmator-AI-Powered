# 🎯 Activities & Miscellaneous Cost Estimators

## Overview

Two new LLM-powered estimators complete the intelligent cost estimation system:

1. **Activities Cost Estimator** - Estimates attraction entry fees, tours, experiences
2. **Miscellaneous Cost Estimator** - Estimates tips, souvenirs, incidentals

---

## 1. Activities Cost Estimator

### Problem (Before):
```python
async def _estimate_activities_cost(self, request: TravelRequest, trip_duration: int) -> float:
    avg_activity_price = 40.0  # ❌ Fixed rate
    return avg_activity_price * trip_duration * request.travelers
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Fixed $40/day regardless of destination
- ❌ Ignores that Sri Lankan temples are free
- ❌ Ignores that Tokyo museums cost $15-20
- ❌ No vibe consideration (cultural vs adventure)

**Example:** Matara, Sri Lanka (Cultural)
- **Old system:** $40/day × 2 days × 3 = **$240**
- **Reality:** Most attractions free/cheap = **$60-90**
- **Error:** 170-300% overcharge! 😱

### Solution (LLM-Powered):

```python
class ActivitiesCostEstimator:
    async def estimate_activities_cost(
        self,
        destination: str,
        country: str,
        num_travelers: int,
        trip_duration_days: int,
        vibe: VibeType,
        activities: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # LLM analyzes:
        # 1. Top attractions and their entry fees
        # 2. Free activities (beaches, temples, parks)
        # 3. Vibe-specific activities
        # 4. Realistic daily spending
```

### LLM Analysis for Matara, Sri Lanka (Cultural):

**Step 1: Identify Top Attractions**
```
✅ Dondra Head Lighthouse - $2 entry
✅ Paravi Duwa Temple - Free
✅ Matara Fort - Free
✅ Matara Beach - Free
✅ Weherahena Temple - Free/small donation
```

**Step 2: Cultural Vibe Preferences**
```
Focus on: Temples, historical sites, local culture
Avoid: Expensive tours, luxury experiences
Budget allocation: 60% attractions, 30% experiences, 10% equipment
```

**Step 3: Calculate Daily Cost**
```
Daily per person:
- Main attractions: $3-4 (mostly free, some small fees)
- Cultural experiences: $5-6 (local guide, donations)
- Equipment/misc: $1-2
TOTAL: $10-12/day/person
```

**Result:**
- **Daily per person:** $10-12
- **Total (3 travelers, 2 days):** **$60-72**
- **Savings:** $168-180 vs old system!

## 2. Miscellaneous Cost Estimator

### Problem (Before):
```python
async def _estimate_miscellaneous_cost(self, request: TravelRequest, trip_duration: int) -> float:
    return 10.0 * trip_duration * request.travelers  # ❌ Fixed rate
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Fixed $10/day regardless of destination
- ❌ Ignores tipping customs (mandatory in US, not in Sri Lanka)
- ❌ Ignores souvenir costs (expensive in Switzerland, cheap in Thailand)
- ❌ No country-specific adjustments

**Example:** Matara, Sri Lanka
- **Old system:** $10/day × 2 days × 3 = **$60**
- **Reality:** Tips optional, souvenirs cheap = **$36-48**
- **Error:** 25-65% overcharge

### Solution (LLM-Powered):

```python
class MiscellaneousCostEstimator:
    async def estimate_miscellaneous_cost(
        self,
        destination: str,
        country: str,
        num_travelers: int,
        trip_duration_days: int,
        vibe: VibeType
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # LLM analyzes:
        # 1. Tipping customs and expectations
        # 2. Souvenir prices (local crafts)
        # 3. Incidentals (water, toiletries, SIM card)
        # 4. Realistic daily spending
```

### LLM Analysis for Matara, Sri Lanka:

**Step 1: Tipping Culture**
```
✅ NOT mandatory in restaurants
✅ Small tips appreciated for guides ($2-3)
✅ Hotel staff tips optional ($1-2)
Daily allocation: $1-2/person
```

**Step 2: Souvenirs**
```
Local prices:
- Handmade crafts: $2-5
- Postcards: $0.50
- Small gifts: $3-8
- Tea/spices: $5-10

Daily allocation: $3-4/person
```

**Step 3: Incidentals**
```
- Bottled water: $0.50/bottle (tap water safe in hotels)
- SIM card: $5-10 one-time
- Sunscreen: $5-8 (bring from home if possible)
- Toiletries: $2-3

Daily allocation: $2-3/person
```

**Step 4: Contingency**
```
Unexpected expenses: $1/person/day
```

**Result:**
- **Daily per person:** $7-10
- **Total (3 travelers, 2 days):** **$42-60**
- **Breakdown:**
  - Tips: $6-12
  - Souvenirs: $18-24
  - Incidentals: $12-18
  - Contingency: $6
