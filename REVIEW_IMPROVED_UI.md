## 🔍 Option 1: Visual Code Review (2 minutes)

Open the file and review the code:

```

Key sections to look at:

## 🖥️ Option 2: Test in Browser (5 minutes) - RECOMMENDED

### Step 1: Integrate the Component

Open `src/components/Results.jsx` and add the import at the top:

```javascript
// Add this import near the top with other imports
import ImprovedCostsTab from './ImprovedCostsTab'
```

### Step 2: Replace the Costs Tab

Find the `CostsTab` usage (around line 210) and replace it:

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
{activeTab === 'costs' && (
  <motion.div ...>
    <CostsTab results={results} formData={formData} />
  </motion.div>
)}
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
{activeTab === 'costs' && (
  <motion.div ...>
    <ImprovedCostsTab results={results} formData={formData} />
  </motion.div>
)}
```

### Step 3: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Travel Flow

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Fill in a travel request:
   - From: Galle
   - To: Paris
   - Dates: Oct 22 - Oct 27, 2025
   - Travelers: 4
   - Vibe: Cultural
3. Submit and view results
4. Click the **"Costs"** tab
5. **Click on each cost item** to expand details

### What to Look For:

✅ **At the top:** "Understanding Your Costs" explanation card
✅ **Each cost item:** Has a badge (✓ Real Data or ≈ AI Estimate)
✅ **Click flights:** See airline details, per-person price, "This is a real price from Google Flights"
✅ **Click hotels:** See hotel name, nightly rate, rooms calculation
✅ **Click activities:** See daily budget breakdown and what's included
✅ **At bottom:** Progress bars showing % verified vs estimated

---

## 🔄 Option 3: Side-by-Side Comparison (10 minutes)

To compare old vs new side-by-side:

### Create a toggle in Results.jsx:

```javascript
// At the top of Results component
const [useImprovedCosts, setUseImprovedCosts] = useState(true)

// Add a toggle button in the header
<button 
  onClick={() => setUseImprovedCosts(!useImprovedCosts)}
  className="text-sm px-3 py-1 border rounded"
>
  {useImprovedCosts ? 'Show Old UI' : 'Show New UI'}
</button>

// In the costs tab section
{activeTab === 'costs' && (
  <motion.div ...>
    {useImprovedCosts ? (
      <ImprovedCostsTab results={results} formData={formData} />
    ) : (
      <CostsTab results={results} formData={formData} />
    )}
  </motion.div>
)}
```

Now you can toggle between old and new to see the difference!
