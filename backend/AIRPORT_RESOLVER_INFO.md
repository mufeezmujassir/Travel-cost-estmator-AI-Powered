# Smart Airport Resolver - No More Manual Mapping! 🚀

## The Problem We Solved

**Before:** Had to manually map every city to an airport code
- Galle → CMB
- Kandy → CMB  
- Ella → CMB
- ... (would need 10,000+ mappings!)

**After:** Automatic intelligent resolution for ANY city! ✅

---

## How It Works

The new `AirportResolver` uses a **5-tier strategy** to find the nearest airport:

### Tier 1: Airport Code Detection (Instant)
```
User types: "JFK" → Returns: JFK
User types: "NYC" → Returns: JFK (metro code normalization)
```

### Tier 2: Core City Map (Instant - 100+ cities)
```
User types: "Galle" → Returns: CMB (from curated map)
User types: "Tokyo" → Returns: HND (from curated map)
```
**Covers:** Top 100+ most searched cities worldwide

### Tier 3: Smart Web Search (2-5 seconds)
```
User types: "Bali" → Searches: "nearest airport to Bali IATA code"
                  → Finds: DPS (Ngurah Rai International)
                  → Caches for next time
```
**For:** Cities not in the core map

### Tier 4: Country Detection & Fallback
```
User types: "Some Small City, Sri Lanka" 
         → Detects: Sri Lanka
         → Returns: CMB (country's main airport)
```
**For:** Obscure cities where nearest airport search fails

### Tier 5: Return UNKNOWN
Only if all strategies fail

## Example: How It Handles Different Cities

### Example 1: Popular City (in core map)
```
User: "Galle to Tokyo"
✈️ Resolved 'Galle' → CMB (from core map) - 0.15ms
✈️ Resolved 'Tokyo' → HND (from core map) - 0.12ms
✅ Found 11 real flights from SERP API
```

### Example 2: Smaller City (not in core map)
```
User: "Matara to Bangkok"
✈️ Resolved 'Matara' → CMB (from core map) - 0.18ms
✈️ Resolved 'Bangkok' → BKK (from core map) - 0.13ms
✅ Found 10 real flights from SERP API
```
*Note: Even though Matara is small, we added all Sri Lankan cities to core map!*

### Example 3: Tourist Destination (using smart search)
```
User: "Bali to Singapore"
✈️ Resolved 'Bali' → DPS (from smart search) - 2.3s
✈️ Resolved 'Singapore' → SIN (from core map) - 0.11ms
✅ Found 8 real flights from SERP API

[Next user searches "Bali"...]
✈️ Resolved 'Bali' → DPS (from cache) - 0.09ms
```

### Example 4: Obscure City (using country fallback)
```
User: "Hambantota, Sri Lanka to Dubai"
✈️ Resolved 'Hambantota' → CMB (from detected country) - 3.1s
✈️ Resolved 'Dubai' → DXB (from core map) - 0.10ms
✅ Found 6 real flights from SERP API
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files:
- `backend/services/airport_resolver.py` - Smart resolver logic
- `backend/services/serp_service.py` - Integration
- `backend/test_smart_resolver.py` - Test suite

### How to Add More Cities to Core Map:

```python
# In airport_resolver.py, CORE_CITY_MAP
"your city": "AIRPORT_CODE",  # Comment
```

Example:
```python
"phuket": "HKT",  # Phuket International Airport
"krabi": "KBV",   # Krabi Airport
```

### Cache:
- In-memory dictionary
- Persists during app runtime
- Could be extended to Redis/database for persistence
