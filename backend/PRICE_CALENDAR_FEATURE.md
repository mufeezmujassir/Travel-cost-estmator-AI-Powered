# 📊 Price Calendar Feature - Like Google Flights!

## ✅ Feature Implemented Successfully!

Just like Google Flights' date grid and price graph, our system now analyzes prices across different dates and tells users:
- 💚 **Which dates are CHEAP**
- 💛 **Which dates are MODERATE**  
- 🔴 **Which dates are EXPENSIVE**

---

## 🎯 What It Does:

### Before (Without Price Calendar):
```
User: "I want to fly Oct 22 to Oct 27"
System: "Here are flights for Oct 22 - $509"
User: "Is this a good price? Should I change dates?"
System: "🤷 I don't know"
```

### After (With Price Calendar):
```
User: "I want to fly Oct 22 to Oct 27"
System: 
  ✈️ Flights for Oct 22: $509
  
  📊 PRICE ANALYSIS:
  💡 Your date (Oct 22) has MODERATE pricing at $509
  💎 Best deal: Oct 19 costs only $294 (save $215!)
  📅 Cheap dates nearby: Oct 19
  
  PRICE CALENDAR:
  Oct 19 (Sun): $294 💚 CHEAP - Save $215!
  Oct 22 (Wed): $509 💛 MODERATE (your date)
  Oct 25 (Sat): $644 🔴 EXPENSIVE +$135
```
