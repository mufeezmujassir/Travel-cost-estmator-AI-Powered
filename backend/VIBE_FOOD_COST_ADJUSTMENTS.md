## Implementation Details

### In `food_cost_estimator.py`:

```python
def _vibe_to_budget_style(self, vibe: VibeType) -> str:
    """Map vibe to budget style"""
    mapping = {
        VibeType.ROMANTIC: "Balanced (leaning upscale)",
        VibeType.ADVENTURE: "Balanced (practical meals)",
        VibeType.BEACH: "Balanced (casual dining)",

    }
    return mapping.get(vibe, "Balanced")
```

### Fallback Multipliers:

```python
if vibe == VibeType.CULINARY:
    daily_per_person = base_daily * 1.5
elif vibe == VibeType.ROMANTIC:
    daily_per_person = base_daily * 1.3
elif vibe == VibeType.WELLNESS:
    daily_per_person = base_daily * 1.2

    daily_per_person = base_daily
