# AI Customer Support Chatbot Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the AI Customer Support Chatbot feature for the Travel Cost Estimator application.

## ü§ñ Feature Overview

The AI Customer Support Chatbot provides automated customer service using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. It allows users to get instant help with:

- Travel cost estimation questions
- How to use the travel planning system
- Account and subscription issues
- Technical support for the website
- General travel advice

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **ChatWidget.jsx**: Floating chat interface component
- **Axios Integration**: Communicates with backend API

### Backend Components
- **chat_routes.py**: FastAPI endpoint for chat functionality
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo model
- **System Prompt**: Defines bot behavior and expertise

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Add the following to your `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Update your `.env.example` file:
```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Backend Dependencies

The following dependency has been added to `backend/requirements.txt`:
```bash
openai==1.3.5
```

Install the updated dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Backend Integration

The chat endpoint is automatically available at:
```
POST /api/chat
```

Request format:
```json
{
  "message": "user question here"
}
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "reply": "AI response here"
}
```

### 4. Frontend Integration

The ChatWidget component is automatically included in the main application layout. No additional setup is required.

## üé® UI Features

### Chat Widget
- Floating chat icon in the bottom-right corner
- Clean, modern interface with message bubbles
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Message Display
- **User Messages**: Blue bubbles on the right side
- **Bot Messages**: Gray bubbles on the left side
- **Loading Indicators**: Animated dots during AI processing
- **Welcome Message**: Automatic greeting when chat opens

### User Experience
- Send messages by pressing Enter or clicking Send
- Auto-scroll to latest messages
- Error handling for network issues
- Graceful fallback messages for API failures

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoint (`/api/chat`)

1. **Input Validation**: Uses Pydantic models for request/response
2. **OpenAI Integration**: Calls GPT-3.5-turbo with system prompt
3. **Error Handling**: Catches API and network errors
4. **Security**: Protected by existing CORS middleware

### Frontend Component (`ChatWidget.jsx`)

1. **State Management**: React hooks for messages and input
2. **API Communication**: Axios for backend requests
3. **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for styling
4. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and focus management

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- API key stored in environment variables
- Rate limiting can be added via middleware
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- CORS configuration protects against unauthorized access

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

- Backend logs API calls and errors
- Frontend console logs for debugging
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Sorry, I'm having trouble responding right now"**
   - Check OpenAI API key in environment variables
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check OpenAI service status

2. **Chat widget not appearing**
   - Verify component is imported in App.jsx
   - Check for CSS conflicts
   - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

3. **Messages not sending**
   - Check browser console for network errors
   - Verify backend endpoint is accessible
   - Confirm CORS configuration allows requests

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
# Backend
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Frontend (in browser console)
localStorage.debug = '*'
```

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

1. **Conversation History**: Store chat history in database
2. **User Authentication**: Personalized responses based on user data
3. **Rich Media**: Support for images and links in responses
4. **Multi-language**: Translation support for international users
5. **Analytics**: Track common questions and user satisfaction
6. **Handoff**: Escalate to human agents for complex issues

## üìö API Documentation

### POST `/api/chat`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "string"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 500: Internal server error (with fallback message)

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Travel Questions
```
User: How do I estimate travel costs?
Bot: To estimate travel costs, enter your origin and destination cities, select travel dates, and choose your travel vibe. Our AI will analyze flight prices, accommodation costs, food expenses, and activities to provide a comprehensive cost breakdown.
```

### Technical Support
```
User: I can't log in to my account
Bot: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble logging in. Please check that you're using the correct email and password. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it using the "Forgot Password" link on the login page. If issues persist, please contact our support team.
