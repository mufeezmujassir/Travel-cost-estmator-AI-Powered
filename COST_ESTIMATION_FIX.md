# Cost Estimation Fix - Use Cheapest Flight

## Issue
The Cost Breakdown was showing **$8264 for flights** (2 travelers) when the cheapest available flight was only **$2994 total** ($1497 per person × 2 travelers).

### Calculation:
- **Shown**: $8264 ÷ 2 = $4132 per traveler
- **Expected**: $1497 × 2 = $2994 total
- **Difference**: $5270 overcharge!

## Root Cause

The `CostEstimationAgent` was using `flights[0]` (first flight in array) to calculate costs:

```python
# backend/agents/cost_estimation_agent.py, line 70 (OLD)
flights_cost = flights[0].get("price", 0) * request.travelers
```

### Why This Was Wrong:

1. **Assumed `flights[0]` was cheapest** - but the backend flight scoring algorithm prioritized "direct flights" over "cheap flights"
2. **SriLankan was `flights[0]`** - a direct flight at $4132 total ($2066/person × 2)
3. **China Eastern was `flights[1]`** - cheaper at $2994 total ($1497/person × 2) but had 1 stop

### Example from User's Search:
```
flights = [
  { airline: "SriLankan", price: 4132, stops: 0 },    # [0] - Used for cost calc ❌
  { airline: "China Eastern", price: 2994, stops: 1 }, # [1] - Actually cheapest ✓
  { airline: "Etihad", price: 2996, stops: 1 }        # [2]
]
```

## Solution

Updated the cost calculation to **find and use the cheapest flight**:

```python
# backend/agents/cost_estimation_agent.py, line 70-73 (NEW)
# Find the cheapest flight by price
cheapest_flight = min(flights, key=lambda x: x.get("price", float('inf')))
# Price is already total for all travelers (multiplied in FlightSearchAgent)
flights_cost = cheapest_flight.get("price", 0)
```

## Result

### Before Fix:
```
Cost Breakdown:
✈️ Flights (2 travelers)         $8264.00  ❌ (using SriLankan)
🏨 Accommodation                  $1780.00
🚗 Local Transportation            $559.22
⭐ Activities & Experiences        $350.00
👥 Food & Dining                   $600.00
💰 Miscellaneous                   $100.00
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Estimated Cost              $11,653.22
```

### After Fix:
```
Cost Breakdown:
✈️ Flights (2 travelers)         $2994.00  ✓ (using China Eastern)
🏨 Accommodation                  $1780.00
🚗 Local Transportation            $559.22
⭐ Activities & Experiences        $350.00
👥 Food & Dining                   $600.00
💰 Miscellaneous                   $100.00
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Estimated Cost              $6,383.22
```

**Savings**: $5,270 (45% reduction!)

## Impact

### User Experience:
- ✅ **Accurate cost estimates** - uses cheapest available option
- ✅ **Matches flight selection** - same flight shown in "Best Flight" card
- ✅ **Better budget planning** - users see realistic minimum costs
- ✅ **No confusion** - all prices now consistent across UI

### Technical:
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - still works with existing data structure
- ✅ **Backwards compatible** - handles empty flights array gracefully
- ✅ **Robust** - uses `min()` with safe default for missing prices

## Files Modified

**`backend/agents/cost_estimation_agent.py`**:
- Line 64-73: Updated flight cost calculation
- Changed from: `flights[0].get("price", 0) * request.travelers`
- Changed to: `min(flights, key=lambda x: x.get("price", float('inf'))).get("price", 0)`
- Removed redundant `* request.travelers` (price already includes all travelers)

## Testing

### Test Case: Galle → Paris (2 travelers)
- **Available Flights**:
  - China Eastern: $2994 total ($1497/person) ✓ Cheapest
  - Etihad: $2996 total ($1498/person)
  - SriLankan: $4132 total ($2066/person)
- **Cost Breakdown**: Should use $2994 ✓
- **Overview "Best Flight"**: Should show $1497/person ✓

### Edge Cases:
- **No flights**: Returns $0 (handled by empty array check)
- **Single flight**: Uses that flight's price ✓
- **All same price**: Uses any (all equivalent) ✓

## Related Fixes

This fix completes the pricing consistency improvements:

1. ✅ **UI Overview** - Now finds cheapest flight for display
2. ✅ **UI Flights Tab** - Shows per-person prices correctly
3. ✅ **Backend Cost Estimation** - Uses cheapest flight (THIS FIX)
4. ⏳ **Backend Flight Scoring** - Still needs fix (separate issue)

## Deployment

- **Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment
- **Testing**: Required
- **Rollback**: Safe (single file change)
- **Impact**: High - affects all flight cost calculations
