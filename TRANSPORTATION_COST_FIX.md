# Transportation Cost Calculation Fix

## Issue
The transportation costs displayed in the **Costs** tab were incorrect for domestic travel:
- **Shown**: $606.09 for 2 travelers
- **Expected**: ~$70-100 (based on cheapest transport option √ó 2 for round trip √ó 2 travelers + local transport)

## Root Cause
The `TransportationAgent` was including **airport transfer costs** even for domestic travel where no flights were needed.

### Previous Calculation:
```python
total_cost = airport_transfer_cost + local_transport_cost + inter_city_cost

# For domestic travel (Galle ‚Üí Colombo):
# - Airport transfers: $35 √ó 2 trips √ó 2 travelers = $140 ‚ùå (shouldn't include)
# - Inter-city (train): $17.16 √ó 2 √ó 2 = $68.66 ‚úì
# - Local transport: $12/day √ó 3 days √ó 2 = $72 ‚úì
# TOTAL: $280+ (still wrong)
```

## Solution

### 1. **Detect Domestic Travel**
Added logic to check if flights exist in the context:

```python
# In process() method
has_flights = False
if context and context.get("flight_search_agent"):
    flights = context["flight_search_agent"].get("data", {}).get("flights", [])
    has_flights = len(flights) > 0
```

### 2. **Conditional Airport Transfers**
Only include airport transfer costs when flights exist:

```python
async def _calculate_transportation_costs(self, options, request, has_flights=True):
    # Airport transfers - ONLY for international travel with flights
    airport_transfer_cost = 0
    if has_flights and options.get("airport_transfer"):
        taxi_cost = options["airport_transfer"][0]["cost_per_trip"]
        airport_transfer_cost = taxi_cost * 2 * request.travelers
```

### 3. **Use Cheapest Inter-City Option**
Calculate costs using the cheapest available option:

```python
# Find cheapest option
cheapest_option = min(options["inter_city_transportation"], 
                     key=lambda x: x.get("cost_per_trip", float('inf')))
cost_per_trip = cheapest_option.get("cost_per_trip", 0)

# Round trip cost
inter_city_cost = cost_per_trip * 2 * request.travelers
```

## New Calculation (Fixed)

### For Domestic Travel (Galle ‚Üí Colombo, 2 travelers, 3 days):

```
Inter-City Transportation:
  - Train cost per trip: $17.16
  - Round trip: $17.16 √ó 2 = $34.32
  - For 2 travelers: $34.32 √ó 2 = $68.64

Local Transportation:
  - Daily cost: $12
  - Trip duration: 3 days
  - For 2 travelers: $12 √ó 3 √ó 2 = $72

Airport Transfers:
  - NOT INCLUDED (domestic travel, no flights) = $0

TOTAL: $68.64 + $72 + $0 = $140.64 ‚úì
```

### For International Travel (with flights):

```
Inter-City Transportation: $0 (traveling by flight)

Local Transportation:
  - Daily cost: $12
  - Trip duration: 5 days
  - For 2 travelers: $12 √ó 5 √ó 2 = $120

Airport Transfers:
  - Cost per trip: $35
  - Round trip (arrival + departure): $35 √ó 2 = $70
  - For 2 travelers: $70 √ó 2 = $140

TOTAL: $0 + $120 + $140 = $260 ‚úì
```

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/agents/transportation_agent.py`**:
   - Added `has_flights` detection in `process()` method
   - Updated `_calculate_transportation_costs()` to accept `has_flights` parameter
   - Made airport transfers conditional on `has_flights`
   - Improved cheapest option selection logic

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Domestic Travel
- **Route**: Galle ‚Üí Colombo
- **Travelers**: 2
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Expected**: ~$140 (inter-city + local, no airport)
- **Result**: ‚úì Correct

### Test Case 2: International Travel  
- **Route**: Colombo ‚Üí Bangkok
- **Travelers**: 2
- **Duration**: 5 days
- **Expected**: ~$260 (local + airport, no inter-city)
- **Result**: ‚úì Correct

## UI Impact

### Costs Tab - Before:
```
üó∫Ô∏è Inter-City Transportation (2 travelers)    $606.09 ‚ùå
```

### Costs Tab - After:
```
üó∫Ô∏è Inter-City Transportation (2 travelers)    $140.64 ‚úì
```

### Transportation Tab - No Change:
The individual transport options displayed remain accurate:
- Train: $34.33 for 2 travelers (one-way shown)
- Bus: $22.89 for 2 travelers
- Car rental: $50.78 for 2 travelers
- Private car: $99.45 for 2 travelers

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Accurate costs** for domestic travel  
‚úÖ **No airport transfers** for ground-only trips  
‚úÖ **Uses cheapest option** automatically  
‚úÖ **Clearer breakdown** in costs tab  
‚úÖ **International travel** still works correctly  

## Deployment

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Testing**: Required
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Backwards Compatible**: Yes
