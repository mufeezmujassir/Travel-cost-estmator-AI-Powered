- **subscriptionApi**: Handles API calls to backend
- **Backend routes**: 
  - GET /api/subscription/status
  - GET /api/subscription/usage
  - GET /api/subscription/tiers
  - POST /api/subscription/check-trip-limit
  - POST /api/payment/create-checkout-session
  - POST /api/payment/create-subscription
