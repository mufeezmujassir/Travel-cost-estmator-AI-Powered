# AI Customer Support Chatbot - Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate ChatWidget Rendering
**Problem**: The ChatWidget component was being rendered twice in App.jsx, which could cause conflicts.
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate ChatWidget from inside the `<main>` tag.

### 2. OpenAI Client Initialization Issues
**Problem**: The newer OpenAI library (v1.3.5) was causing initialization errors with the httpx client.
**Fix**: Reverted to the older OpenAI API syntax that's compatible with the installed version.

### 3. Exception Handling
**Problem**: Duplicate exception handlers in the chat endpoint.
**Fix**: Consolidated exception handling into a single block.

### 4. Model Name Compatibility
**Problem**: The model name "gpt-3.5-turbo" may not be available in older API versions.
**Fix**: Updated to "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613" which is compatible with the older API.
